There are tons of useful things in here:

- The usefulness of [“Oh My ZSH!”](http://ohmyz.sh/) is already built–in.
- [🚀⭐️ Spaceships](https://github.com/spaceship-prompt/spaceship-prompt) as a prompt.
- 🐟 [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)-like autosuggestions.
- Syntax highlighting of commands while they are typed.
- Automatically closing and deleting of quotes and brackets when you type them.
- Browser-like substring search for history.
- [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen) for dependency management.
- Useful [aliases](./lib/aliases.zsh).
- Git config, global `.gitignore` file and aliases.
- Dotfiles synchronization (`sync.py`) with backup.
- Restoring old dotfiles (`restore.py`) from backup.
- A lot of [useful bins](https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles/tree/master/bin).
- `update` script for updating dotfiles, npm, brew, gems, etc.

## Installation

Dotfiles are installed by running one of the following commands in your terminal, just copy one of the following commands and execute in the terminal:

Tell Git who you are using these commands:

```sh
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.email "email@yoursite.com"
git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.name "Name Lastname"
```

Clone dotfiles repo:

```sh
# Clone dotfiles repo
git clone https://github.com/denysdovhan/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles

# Go to the dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

## Updating

Use single command to get latest updates:

```
update
```

This command will update dotfiles, their dependencies, `brew` or `apt-get` packages, global `npm` dependencies, `gem`s, `apm` plugins.

## Under the hood

> **Note:** You may put your custom settings into `~/.zshlocal`.

### Projects tree

I suggest you to organize project folder as follows:

```
~/Projects
├── Forks       # for GitHub fork
├── Job         # for job projects
├── Playground  # for short-term experiments
└── Repos       # for long-term projects
```
